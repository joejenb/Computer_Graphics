# Living Room


## Running the program

Navigate to Computer_Graphics and run

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

This will start running a server on a given port, this port number will be outputted in the terminal(most likely port 8000).

For me the program executes considerably better in firefox instead of chrome, so navigate to 
```bash
http://localhost:8000/code/living_room.html
```
in firefox.


You will then be able to interact with the system using both the buttons found along the bottom of the window(to trigger animations, change view and turn on/off lighting) and through using the arrow keys on your keyboard(to rotate and change the angle of the room)
